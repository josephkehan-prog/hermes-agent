# GitHub Code Review

Perform code reviews on local changes before pushing, or review open PRs on GitHub. Most of this skill uses plain `git` — the `gh`/`curl` split only matters for PR-level interactions.

## Prerequisites

- Authenticated with GitHub (see `github-auth` skill)
- Inside a git repository

### Setup (for PR interactions)

```bash
if command -v gh &>/dev/null && gh auth status &>/dev/null; then
  AUTH="gh"
else
  AUTH="git"
  if [ -z "$GITHUB_TOKEN" ]; then
    if _hermes_env="${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/.env"; [ -f "$_hermes_env" ] && grep -q "^GITHUB_TOKEN=" "$_hermes_env"; then
      GITHUB_TOKEN=$(grep "^GITHUB_TOKEN=" "$_hermes_env" | head -1 | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d '\n\r')
    elif grep -q "github.com" ~/.git-credentials 2>/dev/null; then
      GITHUB_TOKEN=$(grep "github.com" ~/.git-credentials 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed 's|https://[^:]*:\([^@]*\)@.*|\1|')
    fi
  fi
fi

REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin)
OWNER_REPO=$(echo "$REMOTE_URL" | sed -E 's|.*github\.com[:/]||; s|\.git$||')
OWNER=$(echo "$OWNER_REPO" | cut -d/ -f1)
REPO=$(echo "$OWNER_REPO" | cut -d/ -f2)
```

## 1. Reviewing Local Changes (Pre-Push)

This is pure `git` — works everywhere, no API needed.

### Get the Diff

```bash
# Staged changes (what would be committed)
git diff --staged

# All changes vs main (what a PR would contain)
git diff main...HEAD

# File names only
git diff main...HEAD --name-only

# Stat summary (insertions/deletions per file)
git diff main...HEAD --stat
```

### Review Strategy

1. **Get the big picture first:**

```bash
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git log main..HEAD --oneline
```

2. **Review file by file** — use `read_file` on changed files for full context, and the diff to see what changed:

```bash
git diff main...HEAD -- src/auth/login.py
```

3. **Check for common issues:**

```bash
# Debug statements, TODOs, console.logs left behind
git diff main...HEAD | grep -n "print(\|console\.log\|TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX\|debugger"

# Large files accidentally staged
git diff main...HEAD --stat | sort -t'|' -k2 -rn | head -10

# Secrets or credential patterns
git diff main...HEAD | grep -in "password\|secret\|api_key\|token.*=\|private_key"

# Merge conflict markers
git diff main...HEAD | grep -n "<<<<<<\|>>>>>>\|======="
```

4. **Present structured feedback** to the user.

### Review Output Format

Present findings grouped under `### Critical` / `### Warnings` / `### Suggestions` / `### Looks Good`, each bullet as `**file.py:line** — description. Suggestion: fix.`. Full template with severity icons and a verdict guide: `references/review-output-template.md`.

## 2. Reviewing a Pull Request on GitHub

### View PR Details

**With gh:**

```bash
gh pr view 123
gh pr diff 123
gh pr diff 123 --name-only
```

**Without `gh`:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}` for details,
`.../files` for the changed-file list — full snippets in
`references/curl-fallbacks.md#view-pr-details`.

### Check Out PR Locally for Full Review

This works with plain `git` — no `gh` needed:

```bash
# Fetch the PR branch and check it out
git fetch origin pull/123/head:pr-123
git checkout pr-123

# Now you can use read_file, search_files, run tests, etc.

# View diff against the base branch
git diff main...pr-123
```

**With gh (shortcut):**

```bash
gh pr checkout 123
```

### Leave Comments on a PR

**General PR comment — with gh:**

```bash
gh pr comment 123 --body "Overall looks good, a few suggestions below."
```

**Without `gh`:** `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n}/comments` — full
snippet in `references/curl-fallbacks.md#general-pr-comment`.

### Leave Inline Review Comments

**With gh (via API):**

```bash
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view 123 --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid')

gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/123/comments \
  --method POST \
  -f body="This could be simplified with a list comprehension." \
  -f path="src/auth/login.py" \
  -f commit_id="$HEAD_SHA" \
  -f line=45 \
  -f side="RIGHT"
```

**Without `gh`:** same endpoint via raw `curl`, needs the head SHA fetched
first — full snippet in
`references/curl-fallbacks.md#single-inline-review-comment`.

### Submit a Formal Review (Approve / Request Changes)

**With gh:**

```bash
gh pr review 123 --approve --body "LGTM!"
gh pr review 123 --request-changes --body "See inline comments."
gh pr review 123 --comment --body "Some suggestions, nothing blocking."
```

**Without `gh`:** `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/reviews` with a
`comments` array submits every inline comment atomically alongside the
approve/request-changes/comment verdict — full snippet in
`references/curl-fallbacks.md#submit-a-formal-review--multi-comment-atomic`.

Event values: `"APPROVE"`, `"REQUEST_CHANGES"`, `"COMMENT"`. The `line` field
refers to the line number in the *new* version of the file; for deleted
lines use `"side": "LEFT"`.

## 3. Review Checklist

When performing a code review (local or PR), systematically check:

### Correctness
- Does the code do what it claims?
- Edge cases handled (empty inputs, nulls, large data, concurrent access)?
- Error paths handled gracefully?

### Security
- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or API keys
- Input validation on user-facing inputs
- No SQL injection, XSS, or path traversal
- Auth/authz checks where needed

### Code Quality
- Clear naming (variables, functions, classes)
- No unnecessary complexity or premature abstraction
- DRY — no duplicated logic that should be extracted
- Functions are focused (single responsibility)

### Testing
- New code paths tested?
- Happy path and error cases covered?
- Tests readable and maintainable?

### Performance
- No N+1 queries or unnecessary loops
- Appropriate caching where beneficial
- No blocking operations in async code paths

### Documentation
- Public APIs documented
- Non-obvious logic has comments explaining "why"
- README updated if behavior changed

## 4. Pre-Push Review Workflow

When the user asks you to "review the code" or "check before pushing":

1. `git diff main...HEAD --stat` — see scope of changes
2. `git diff main...HEAD` — read the full diff
3. For each changed file, use `read_file` if you need more context
4. Apply the checklist above
5. Present findings in the structured format (Critical / Warnings / Suggestions / Looks Good)
6. If critical issues found, offer to fix them before the user pushes

---

## 5. PR Review Workflow (End-to-End)

When the user asks you to "review PR #N", "look at this PR", or gives you a PR URL, follow this recipe:

### Step 1: Set up environment

```bash
source "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/skills/github/github-auth/scripts/gh-env.sh"
# Or run the inline setup block from the top of this skill
```

### Step 2: Gather PR context

Get the PR metadata, description, and list of changed files to understand scope before diving into code.

**With gh:**
```bash
gh pr view 123
gh pr diff 123 --name-only
gh pr checks 123
```

**Without `gh`:** `GET .../pulls/{n}` for details, `.../files` for changed
files — full snippet in `references/curl-fallbacks.md#end-to-end-pr-review--curl-variant-of-step-27`.

### Step 3: Check out the PR locally

This gives you full access to `read_file`, `search_files`, and the ability to run tests.

```bash
git fetch origin pull/$PR_NUMBER/head:pr-$PR_NUMBER
git checkout pr-$PR_NUMBER
```

### Step 4: Read the diff and understand changes

```bash
# Full diff against the base branch
git diff main...HEAD

# Or file-by-file for large PRs
git diff main...HEAD --name-only
# Then for each file:
git diff main...HEAD -- path/to/file.py
```

For each changed file, use `read_file` to see full context around the changes — diffs alone can miss issues visible only with surrounding code.

### Step 5: Run automated checks locally (if applicable)

```bash
# Run tests if there's a test suite
python -m pytest 2>&1 | tail -20
# or: npm test, cargo test, go test ./..., etc.

# Run linter if configured
ruff check . 2>&1 | head -30
# or: eslint, clippy, etc.
```

### Step 6: Apply the review checklist (Section 3)

Go through each category: Correctness, Security, Code Quality, Testing, Performance, Documentation.

### Step 7: Post the review to GitHub

Collect your findings and submit them as a formal review with inline comments.

**With gh:**
```bash
# If no issues — approve
gh pr review $PR_NUMBER --approve --body "Reviewed by Hermes Agent. Code looks clean — good test coverage, no security concerns."

# If issues found — request changes with inline comments
gh pr review $PR_NUMBER --request-changes --body "Found a few issues — see inline comments."
```

**Without `gh`:** `POST .../pulls/{n}/reviews` with a `comments` array and an
`event` of APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES/COMMENT — full snippet in
`references/curl-fallbacks.md#end-to-end-pr-review--curl-variant-of-step-27`.

### Step 8: Also post a summary comment

In addition to inline comments, leave a top-level summary (`gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body "..."`)
so the PR author gets the full picture at a glance. Use the exact structure —
verdict line, severity-icon sections, closing signature — from
`references/review-output-template.md`.

### Step 9: Clean up

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D pr-$PR_NUMBER
```

### Decision: Approve vs Request Changes vs Comment

- **Approve** — no critical or warning-level issues, only minor suggestions or all clear
- **Request Changes** — any critical or warning-level issue that should be fixed before merge
- **Comment** — observations and suggestions, but nothing blocking (use when you're unsure or the PR is a draft)
