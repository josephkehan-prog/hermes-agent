# DCF Variations, Best Practices, and Workflow Details

**When to read this file:** when the target company doesn't fit a standard 5-year
single-segment DCF (high-growth tech, mature/cyclical, multi-segment), or for the
expanded quality-control checklist and the detailed pre-build/during-build/pre-delivery
workflow steps.

## Best Practices

### Model Construction
1. **Build incrementally**: Complete each section before moving to next
2. **Test as building**: Enter sample numbers to verify formulas
3. **Use consistent structure**: Similar calculations follow similar patterns
4. **Comment complex formulas**: Add notes for unusual calculations
5. **Build in checks**: Sum checks and balance checks where applicable

### Documentation
1. **Document all assumptions**: Explain reasoning behind key inputs
2. **Cite data sources**: Note where each data point came from
3. **Explain methodology**: Describe any non-standard approaches
4. **Flag uncertainties**: Highlight areas with limited visibility

### Quality Control
1. **Cross-check calculations**: Verify math in multiple ways
2. **Stress test assumptions**: Run sensitivity to ensure model is robust
3. **Peer review**: Have someone else check formulas
4. **Version control**: Save versions as work progresses

## Common Variations

### High-Growth Technology Companies
- Longer projection period (7-10 years)
- Higher initial growth rates (20-30%)
- Significant margin expansion over time
- Higher WACC (12-15%)
- Model unit economics (users, ARPU, etc.)

### Mature/Stable Companies
- Shorter projection period (3-5 years)
- Modest growth rates (GDP +1-3%)
- Stable margins
- Lower WACC (7-9%)
- Focus on cash generation and capital allocation

### Cyclical Companies
- Model through economic cycle
- Normalize margins at mid-cycle
- Consider trough and peak scenarios
- Adjust beta for cyclicality

### Multi-Segment Companies
- Separate DCFs for each business unit
- Different growth rates and margins by segment
- Sum-of-parts valuation
- Consider synergies

## Workflow Integration

### At Start of DCF Build

1. **Gather market data**:
   - Check for available MCP servers for current market data
   - Use web search/fetch for stock prices, beta, and other market metrics
   - Request from user if specific data is needed

2. **Gather historical financials**:
   - Check for available MCP servers (Daloopa, etc.)
   - Request from user if not available via MCP
   - Manual extraction from 10-Ks if necessary

3. **Begin model construction** using the DCF methodology detailed in this skill

### During Model Construction

1. **Build Excel model** using openpyxl with formulas (not hardcoded values)
2. **Follow xlsx skill conventions** for formula construction and formatting
3. **Apply fill colors only if requested** by user or if specific brand guidelines are provided

### Before Delivering Model (MANDATORY)

1. **Verify structure**:
   - Scenario blocks for Bear/Base/Bull with assumptions across projection years
   - Case selector functional with formulas referencing correct scenario blocks
   - Sensitivity tables at bottom of DCF sheet (not separate sheet)
   - Font colors: Blue inputs, black formulas, green sheet links
   - Cell comments on ALL hardcoded inputs
   - Professional borders around major sections

2. **Recalculate formulas**: Run `python recalc.py model.xlsx 30`

3. **Check output**:
   - If `status` is `"success"` → Continue to step 4
   - If `status` is `"errors_found"` → Check `error_summary` and read [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for debugging guidance

4. **Fix errors and re-run recalc.py** until status is "success"

5. **Spot-check formulas**:
   - Test one FCF formula - does it reference the correct assumption rows?
   - Change case selector - does the consolidation column update properly?
   - Verify revenue formulas reference consolidation column (not nested IF formulas)

6. **Deliver model**

### Available Data Sources

- **MCP servers**: If configured (Daloopa for historical financials)
- **Web search/fetch**: For current stock prices, beta, and market data
- **User-provided data**: Historical financials, consensus estimates
- **Manual extraction**: SEC EDGAR filings as fallback
