# DCF Workflow — Formula Detail and Worked Examples

**When to read this file:** when building a specific step of the DCF (revenue,
opex, FCF, WACC, discounting, terminal value, or the equity bridge) and you need the
full formula derivation, a worked numeric example, or the exact output/CSV format —
not just the one-line summary in the SKILL.md body's "DCF Process Workflow" section.

## Step 1: Data Retrieval and Validation

**Data Sources Priority:**
1. **MCP Servers** (if configured) - Structured financial data from providers like Daloopa
2. **User-Provided Data** - Historical financials from their research
3. **Web Search/Fetch** - Current prices, beta, debt and cash when needed

**Validation Checklist:**
- Verify net debt vs net cash (critical for valuation)
- Confirm diluted shares outstanding (check for recent buybacks/issuances)
- Validate historical margins are consistent with business model
- Cross-check revenue growth rates with industry benchmarks
- Verify tax rate is reasonable (typically 21-28%)

## Step 2: Historical Analysis (3-5 years)

Analyze and document:
- **Revenue growth trends**: Calculate CAGR, identify drivers
- **Margin progression**: Track gross margin, EBIT margin, FCF margin
- **Capital intensity**: D&A and CapEx as % of revenue
- **Working capital efficiency**: NWC changes as % of revenue growth
- **Return metrics**: ROIC, ROE trends

Create summary tables showing:
```
Historical Metrics (LTM):
Revenue: $X million
Revenue growth: X% CAGR
Gross margin: X%
EBIT margin: X%
D&A % of revenue: X%
CapEx % of revenue: X%
FCF margin: X%
```

## Step 3: Build Revenue Projections

**Methodology:**
1. Start with latest actual revenue (LTM or most recent fiscal year)
2. Apply growth rates for each projection year
3. Show both dollar amounts AND calculated growth %

**Growth Rate Framework:**
- Year 1-2: Higher growth reflecting near-term visibility
- Year 3-4: Gradual moderation toward industry average
- Year 5+: Approaching terminal growth rate

**Three-scenario approach:**
```
Bear Case: Conservative growth (e.g., 8-12%)
Base Case: Most likely scenario (e.g., 12-16%)
Bull Case: Optimistic growth (e.g., 16-20%)
```

## Step 4: Operating Expense Modeling

**Fixed/Variable Cost Analysis** — model realistic operating leverage:
- **Sales & Marketing**: Typically 15-40% of revenue depending on business model
- **Research & Development**: Typically 10-30% for technology companies
- **General & Administrative**: Typically 8-15% of revenue, shows leverage as company scales

**Margin expansion framework:**
```
Current State → Target State (Year 5)
Gross Margin: X% → Y% (justify based on scale, efficiency)
EBIT Margin: X% → Y% (result of revenue growth + opex leverage)
```

## Step 5: Free Cash Flow Calculation

**Working Capital Modeling:**
- Calculate as % of revenue change (delta revenue)
- Typical range: -2% to +2% of revenue change
- Negative number = source of cash (working capital release)
- Positive number = use of cash (working capital build)

**Maintenance vs Growth CapEx:**
- Maintenance CapEx: Sustains current operations (~2-3% revenue)
- Growth CapEx: Supports expansion (additional 2-5% revenue)
- Total CapEx should align with company's growth strategy

## Step 6: Cost of Capital (WACC) Research

**Cost of Debt Calculation:**
```
After-Tax Cost of Debt = Pre-Tax Cost of Debt × (1 - Tax Rate)

Determine Pre-Tax Cost of Debt from:
- Credit rating (if available)
- Current yield on company bonds
- Interest expense / Total Debt from financials
```

**Special Cases:**
- **Net Cash Position**: If Cash > Debt, Net Debt is NEGATIVE — Debt Weight may be negative, WACC calculation adjusts accordingly
- **No Debt**: WACC = Cost of Equity

**Typical WACC Ranges:**
- Large Cap, Stable: 7-9%
- Growth Companies: 9-12%
- High Growth/Risk: 12-15%

## Step 7: Discount Rate Application

**Present Value Calculation — worked example (Year 1):**
```
FCF = $1,000
WACC = 10%
Period = 0.5
Discount Factor = 1 / (1.10)^0.5 = 0.9535
PV = $1,000 × 0.9535 = $954
```

**Projection Period Selection:**
- **5 years**: Standard for most analyses
- **7-10 years**: High growth companies with longer runway
- **3 years**: Mature, stable businesses

## Step 8: Terminal Value Calculation

**Terminal Growth Rate Selection:**
- Conservative: 2.0-2.5% (GDP growth rate)
- Moderate: 2.5-3.5%
- Aggressive: 3.5-5.0% (only for market leaders)
- **Do not exceed**: Risk-free rate or long-term GDP growth

**Exit Multiple Method (Alternative to perpetuity growth):**
```
Terminal Value = Final Year EBITDA × Exit Multiple

Where Exit Multiple comes from:
- Industry comparable trading multiples
- Precedent transaction multiples
- Typical range: 8-15x EBITDA
```

**PV of Terminal Value**: `Terminal Value / (1 + WACC)^Final Period` — a 5-year model
with mid-year convention uses Final Period = 4.5.

**Terminal Value Sanity Check:**
- Should represent 50-70% of Enterprise Value
- If >75%, model may be over-reliant on terminal assumptions
- If <40%, check if terminal assumptions are too conservative

## Step 9: Enterprise to Equity Value Bridge

**Critical Adjustments:**
- **Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents** — if positive, subtract from EV; if negative (Net Cash), add to EV
- **Use Diluted Shares**: Includes options, RSUs, convertible securities
- **Other adjustments** (if applicable): minority interests, pension liabilities, operating lease obligations

**Valuation Output Format:**
```csv
Valuation Component,Amount ($M)
PV Explicit FCFs,X.X
PV Terminal Value,Y.Y
Enterprise Value,Z.Z
(-) Net Debt,A.A
Equity Value,B.B
,,
Shares Outstanding (M),C.C
Implied Price per Share,$XX.XX
Current Share Price,$YY.YY
Implied Upside/(Downside),+XX%
```

## Step 10: Sensitivity Analysis

Build **three sensitivity tables** at the bottom of the DCF sheet:

1. **WACC vs Terminal Growth** - Shows enterprise value sensitivity to discount rate and perpetuity growth
2. **Revenue Growth vs EBIT Margin** - Shows impact of top-line growth and operating leverage
3. **Beta vs Risk-Free Rate** - Shows sensitivity to cost of equity components
