# Reference Images

Read this when the user supplies a reference image (style/palette/scene) and you need to know how to intake it and encode it into prompts.

Hermes' `image_generate` tool is **prompt-only** — it accepts a text prompt and an aspect ratio, and returns an image URL. It does **NOT** accept reference images. When the user supplies a reference image, use it to **extract traits in text** that get embedded in every page prompt.

**Intake**: Accept file paths when the user provides them (or pastes images in conversation).
- File path(s) → copy to `refs/NN-ref-{slug}.{ext}` alongside the comic output for provenance
- Pasted image with no path → ask the user for the path via `clarify`, or extract style traits verbally as a text fallback
- No reference → skip this section

**Usage modes** (per reference):

| Usage | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `style` | Extract style traits (line treatment, texture, mood) and append to every page's prompt body |
| `palette` | Extract hex colors and append to every page's prompt body |
| `scene` | Extract scene composition or subject notes and append to the relevant page(s) |

**Record in each page's prompt frontmatter** when refs exist:

```yaml
references:
  - ref_id: 01
    filename: 01-ref-scene.png
    usage: style
    traits: "muted earth tones, soft-edged ink wash, low-contrast backgrounds"
```

Character consistency is driven by **text descriptions** in `characters/characters.md` (written in Step 3) that get embedded inline in every page prompt (Step 5). The optional PNG character sheet generated in Step 7.1 is a human-facing review artifact, not an input to `image_generate`.
