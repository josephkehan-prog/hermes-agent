## Environment

This skill assumes **headless openpyxl** — you are producing an .xlsx file on disk.
Follow the `excel-author` skill's conventions for cell coloring, formulas, named ranges, and sensitivity tables.
Recalculate before delivery: `python /path/to/excel-author/scripts/recalc.py ./out/model.xlsx`.

# 3-Statement Financial Model Template Completion

Complete and populate integrated financial model templates with proper linkages between Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL PRINCIPLES — Read Before Populating Any Template

**Formulas over hardcodes (non-negotiable):**
- Every projection cell, roll-forward, linkage, and subtotal MUST be an Excel formula — never a pre-computed value
- When using Python/openpyxl: write formula strings (`ws["D15"] = "=D14*(1+Assumptions!$B$5)"`), NOT computed results (`ws["D15"] = 12500`)
- The ONLY cells that should contain hardcoded numbers are: (1) historical actuals, (2) assumption drivers in the Assumptions tab
- If you find yourself computing a value in Python and writing the result to a cell — STOP. Write the formula instead.
- Why: the model must flex when scenarios toggle or assumptions change. Hardcodes break every downstream integrity check silently.

**Verify step-by-step with the user:**
1. **After mapping the template** → show the user which tabs/sections you've identified and confirm before touching any cells
2. **After populating historicals** → show the user the historical block and confirm values/periods match source data
3. **After building IS projections** → run the subtotal checks, show the user the projected IS, confirm before moving to BS
4. **After building BS** → show the user the balance check (Assets = L+E) for every period, confirm before moving to CF
5. **After building CF** → show the user the cash tie-out (CF ending cash = BS cash), confirm before finalizing
6. **Do NOT populate the entire model end-to-end and present it complete** — break at each statement, show the work, catch errors early

## Formatting — Professional Blue/Grey Palette (Default unless template/user specifies otherwise)

**Keep colors minimal.** Use only blues and greys for cell fills. Do NOT introduce greens, yellows, oranges, or multiple accent colors — a clean model uses restraint.

| Element | Fill | Font |
|---|---|---|
| Section headers (IS / BS / CF titles) | Dark blue `#1F4E79` | White bold |
| Column headers (FY2024A, FY2025E, etc.) | Light blue `#D9E1F2` | Black bold |
| Input cells (historicals, assumption drivers) | Light grey `#F2F2F2` or white | Blue `#0000FF` |
| Formula cells | White | Black |
| Cross-tab links | White | Green `#008000` |
| Check rows / key totals | Medium blue `#BDD7EE` | Black bold |

**That's 3 blues + 1 grey + white.** If the template has its own color scheme, follow the template instead.

Font color signals *what* a cell is (input/formula/link). Fill color signals *where* you are (header/data/check).

## Model Structure

### Identifying Template Tab Organization

Templates vary in their tab naming conventions and organization. Before populating, review all tabs to understand the template's structure. Below are common tab names and their typical contents:

| Common Tab Names | Contents to Look For |
|------------------|----------------------|
| IS, P&L, Income Statement | Income Statement |
| BS, Balance Sheet | Balance Sheet |
| CF, CFS, Cash Flow | Cash Flow Statement |
| WC, Working Capital | Working Capital Schedule |
| DA, D&A, Depreciation, PP&E | Depreciation & Amortization Schedule |
| Debt, Debt Schedule | Debt Schedule |
| NOL, Tax, DTA | Net Operating Loss Schedule |
| Assumptions, Inputs, Drivers | Driver assumptions and inputs |
| Checks, Audit, Validation | Error-checking dashboard |

**Template Review Checklist**
- Identify which tabs exist in the template (not all templates include every schedule)
- Note any template-specific tabs not listed above
- Understand tab dependencies (e.g., which schedules feed into the main statements)
- Locate input cells vs. formula cells on each tab

### Understanding Template Structure

Before populating a template, familiarize yourself with its existing layout to ensure data is entered in the correct locations and formulas remain intact.

**Identifying Row Structure**
- Locate the model title at top of each tab
- Identify section headers and their visual separation
- Find the units row indicating $ millions, %, x, etc.
- Note column headers distinguishing Actuals vs. Estimates periods
- Confirm period labels (e.g., FY2024A, FY2025E)
- Identify input cells vs. formula cells (typically distinguished by font color)

**Identifying Column Structure**
- Confirm line item labels in leftmost column
- Verify historical years precede projection years
- Note the visual border separating historical from projected periods
- Check for consistent column order across all tabs

**Working with Named Ranges**
Templates often use named ranges for key inputs and outputs. Before entering data:
- Review existing named ranges in the template (Formulas → Name Manager in Excel)
- Common named ranges include: Revenue growth rates, cost percentages, key outputs (Net Income, EBITDA, Total Debt, Cash), scenario selector cell
- Ensure inputs are entered in cells that feed into these named ranges

### Projection Period
- Templates typically project 5 years forward from last historical year
- Verify historical (A) vs. projected (E) columns are clearly separated
- Confirm columns use fiscal year notation (e.g., FY2024A, FY2025E)

## Margin Analysis

**Note: The following margin analysis should only be performed if prompted by the user or if the template explicitly requires it. If no prompt is given, skip this section.**

Calculate and display profitability margins on the Income Statement (IS) tab to track operational efficiency and enable peer comparison.

### Core Margins to Include

| Margin | Formula | What It Measures |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Gross Margin | Gross Profit / Revenue | Pricing power, production efficiency |
| EBITDA Margin | EBITDA / Revenue | Core operating profitability |
| EBIT Margin | EBIT / Revenue | Operating profitability after D&A |
| Net Income Margin | Net Income / Revenue | Bottom-line profitability |

### Income Statement Layout with Margins

Display margin percentages directly below each profit line item:
- Gross Margin % below Gross Profit
- EBIT Margin % below EBIT
- EBITDA Margin % below EBITDA
- Net Income Margin % below Net Income

## Credit Metrics

**Note: The following Credit analysis should only be performed if prompted by the user or if the template explicitly requires it. If no prompt is given, skip this section.**

Calculate and display credit/leverage metrics on the Balance Sheet (BS) tab to assess financial health, debt capacity, and covenant compliance.

### Core Credit Metrics to Include

| Metric | Formula | What It Measures |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Total Debt / EBITDA | Total Debt / LTM EBITDA | Leverage multiple |
| Net Debt / EBITDA | (Total Debt - Cash) / LTM EBITDA | Leverage net of cash |
| Interest Coverage | EBITDA / Interest Expense | Ability to service debt |
| Debt / Total Cap | Total Debt / (Total Debt + Equity) | Capital structure |
| Debt / Equity | Total Debt / Total Equity | Financial leverage |
| Current Ratio | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | Short-term liquidity |
| Quick Ratio | (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities | Immediate liquidity |

### Credit Metric Hierarchy Checks

Validate that Upside shows strongest credit profile:
- Leverage: Upside < Base < Downside (lower is better)
- Coverage: Upside > Base > Downside (higher is better)
- Liquidity: Upside > Base > Downside (higher is better)

### Covenant Compliance Tracking

If debt covenants are known, add explicit compliance checks comparing actual metrics to covenant thresholds.

## Scenario Analysis (Base / Upside / Downside)

Use a scenario toggle (dropdown) in the Assumptions tab with CHOOSE or INDEX/MATCH formulas.

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Base Case | Management guidance or consensus estimates |
| Upside Case | Above-guidance growth, margin expansion |
| Downside Case | Below-trend growth, margin compression |

**Key Drivers to Sensitize**: Revenue growth, Gross margin, SG&A %, DSO/DIO/DPO, CapEx %, Interest rate, Tax rate.

**Scenario Audit Checks**: Toggle switches all statements, BS balances in all scenarios, Cash ties out, Hierarchy holds (Upside > Base > Downside for NI, EBITDA, FCF, margins).

## SEC Filings Data Extraction

If the template specifically requires pulling data from SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q), see [references/sec-filings.md](references/sec-filings.md) for detailed extraction guidance. This reference is only needed when populating templates with public company data from regulatory filings.

## Completing Model Templates

General workflow for completing any 3-statement template while preserving existing formulas:
1. **Analyze structure** — identify input vs. formula cells (font/shading conventions), map which tabs feed others, check named ranges
2. **Fill in data safely** — only edit input cells, use Paste Values to avoid clobbering formulas, match units/sign conventions, enter historicals before drivers
3. **Validate formulas** — trace precedents/dependents, check for hardcodes, watch for #REF!/#DIV/0! and inconsistent formulas across periods
4. **Quality-check each sheet** — IS subtotals, BS balances (Assets = L+E), CF ties to BS cash, supporting schedules roll forward correctly
5. **Cross-statement integrity** — Balance Sheet Balance = 0, Cash Tie-Out = 0, Net Income Link = 0, Retained Earnings roll-forward = 0
6. **Final review** — toggle scenarios, resolve all formula errors, confirm no placeholder values remain, save clean

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the full step-by-step walkthrough with detailed checklists per step.

## Model Validation and Audit

This section consolidates all validation checks and audit procedures for completed templates.

### Core Linkages (Must Always Hold)

See [references/formulas.md](references/formulas.md) for all formula details.

| Check | Formula | Expected Result |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Balance Sheet Balance | Assets - Liabilities - Equity | = 0 |
| Cash Tie-Out | CF Ending Cash - BS Cash | = 0 |
| Cash Monthly vs Annual | Closing Cash (Monthly) - Closing Cash (Annual) | = 0 |
| Net Income Link | IS Net Income - CF Starting Net Income | = 0 |
| Retained Earnings | Prior RE + NI + SBC - Dividends - BS Ending RE | = 0 |
| Equity Financing | ΔCommon Stock/APIC (BS) - Equity Issuance (CFF) | = 0 |
| Year 0 Equity | Equity Raised (Year 0) - Beginning Equity Capital (Year 1) | = 0 |

### Sign Convention Reference

| Statement | Item | Sign Convention |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| CFO | D&A, SBC | Positive (add-back) |
| CFO | ΔAR (increase) | Negative (use of cash) |
| CFO | ΔAP (increase) | Positive (source of cash) |
| CFI | CapEx | Negative |
| CFF | Debt issuance | Positive |
| CFF | Debt repayments | Negative |
| CFF | Dividends | Negative |

### Circular Reference Handling

Interest expense creates circularity: Interest → Net Income → Cash → Debt Balance → Interest

Enable iterative calculation in Excel: File → Options → Formulas → Enable iterative calculation. Set maximum iterations to 100, maximum change to 0.001. Add a circuit breaker toggle in Assumptions tab.

### Check Categories

Nine audit sections: (1) Currency Consistency, (2) Balance Sheet Integrity (Assets - Liabilities - Equity = 0), (3) Cash Flow Integrity (CF cash ties to BS, NI ties to IS, D&A/SBC/WC deltas tie to schedules), (4) Retained Earnings roll-forward, (5) Working Capital (AR/Inventory/AP tie to BS, DSO/DIO/DPO reasonability), (6) Debt Schedule + 6b Equity Financing + 6c NOL Schedule (NOL utilization ≤80% of EBT, DTA ties to BS), (7) Scenario Hierarchy (Upside > Base > Downside for NI/EBITDA/FCF/margins, inverted for leverage), (8) Formula Integrity (no hardcodes, no errors), (9) Credit Metric Thresholds (Green/Yellow/Red flags).

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the full per-section detail.

### Master Check Formula

Aggregate all section statuses into a single master check:
- If all sections pass → "✓ ALL CHECKS PASS"
- If any section fails → "✗ ERRORS DETECTED - REVIEW BELOW"

### Quick Debug Workflow

When Master Status shows errors:
1. Scroll to find red-highlighted sections
2. Identify which check category has failures
3. Navigate to source tab to investigate
4. Fix the underlying issue
5. Return to Checks tab to verify resolution


## Data sources — MCP first, web fallback

Many passages below say "use the S&P Kensho MCP / Daloopa MCP / FactSet MCP". Those are commercial financial-data MCPs from the original Cowork plugin context. In Hermes:

- **If you have any structured financial-data MCP configured** (Hermes supports MCP — see `native-mcp` skill), prefer it for point-in-time comps, precedent transactions, and filings.
- **Otherwise**, fall back to:
  - `web_search` / `web_extract` against SEC EDGAR (`https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar`) for US filings
  - Company IR pages for press releases, earnings decks
  - `browser_navigate` for interactive data portals
  - User-provided data (explicitly ask when the context doesn't have it)
- **Never fabricate**. If a multiple, precedent, or filing number can't be sourced, flag the cell as `[UNSOURCED]` and surface it to the user.
