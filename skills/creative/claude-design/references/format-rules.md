# Format Rules: Decks, Prototypes, Variations, Tweaks, Content

Read this when building a specific artifact type (deck, prototype,
variation set) or wiring up an in-page Tweaks panel.

## Artifact Format Rules (detail)

Default to local files.

For standalone artifacts:

- create a descriptive filename, e.g. `Landing Page.html`, `Command Palette Prototype.html`, `Design System Board.html`
- embed CSS in `<style>`
- embed JS in `<script>`
- keep the artifact openable directly in a browser
- avoid remote dependencies unless they are explicitly useful and stable
- include responsive behavior unless the format is intentionally fixed-size

For significant revisions:

- preserve the previous version as `Name.html`
- create `Name v2.html`, `Name v3.html`, etc.
- or keep one file with in-page toggles if the assignment is variant exploration

For repo implementation:

- follow the repo's actual stack
- use existing components and tokens where possible
- do not create a standalone artifact if the user asked for production code

## Deck Rules

For slide decks, use a fixed-size canvas and scale it to fit the viewport.

Default slide size: 1920×1080, 16:9.

Requirements:

- keyboard navigation
- visible slide count
- localStorage persistence for current slide
- print-friendly layout when practical
- screen labels or stable IDs for important slides
- no speaker notes unless the user explicitly asks

Do not hand-wave a deck as markdown bullets. Create a designed artifact if asked for a deck.

Use 1–2 background colors max unless the brand system requires more.

Keep slides sparse. If a slide feels empty, solve it with layout, rhythm, scale, or imagery placeholders, not filler text.

## Prototype Rules

For interactive prototypes:

- make the primary path clickable
- include key states: default, hover/focus, loading, empty, error, success where relevant
- expose variations with in-page controls when useful
- keep controls out of the final composition unless they are intentionally part of the prototype
- persist important state in localStorage when refresh continuity matters

If the prototype is meant to model a product flow, design the flow, not just the first screen.

## Variation Rules

When exploring, default to at least three options:

1. **Conservative** — closest to existing patterns / lowest risk
2. **Strong-fit** — best interpretation of the brief
3. **Divergent** — more novel, useful for discovering taste boundaries

Variations can explore:

- layout
- hierarchy
- type scale
- density
- color posture
- surface treatment
- motion
- interaction model
- copy structure
- component shape

Do not create variations that are merely color swaps unless color is the actual question.

When the user picks a direction, consolidate. Do not leave the project as a pile of options forever.

## Tweakable Designs in CLI/API Mode

The hosted Claude Design edit-mode toolbar does not exist here.

Still preserve the idea: when useful, add in-page controls called `Tweaks`.

A good `Tweaks` panel can control:

- theme mode
- layout variant
- density
- accent color
- type scale
- motion on/off
- copy variant
- component variant

Keep it small and unobtrusive. The design should look final when tweaks are hidden.

Persist tweak values with localStorage when helpful.

## Content Discipline

Do not add filler content.

Every element must earn its place.

Avoid:

- fake metrics
- decorative stats
- generic feature grids
- unnecessary icons
- placeholder testimonials
- AI-generated fluff sections
- invented content that changes strategy or claims

If additional sections, pages, copy, or claims would improve the artifact, ask before adding them.

When copy is necessary but not final, mark it as draft or placeholder.
