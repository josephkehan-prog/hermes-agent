# Craft Standards: HTML/CSS/JS, React, Typography, Color, Layout, Motion, Imagery

Read this when actually writing the artifact's code and visual design —
the day-to-day craft rules, not the process/taste rules in SKILL.md.

## HTML / CSS / JS Standards

Use modern CSS well:

- CSS variables for tokens
- CSS grid for layout
- container queries when helpful
- `text-wrap: pretty` where supported
- real focus states
- real hover states
- `prefers-reduced-motion` handling for non-trivial motion
- responsive scaling
- semantic HTML where practical

Avoid:

- huge monolithic files when a real repo structure is expected
- fragile hard-coded viewport assumptions
- inaccessible tiny hit targets
- decorative JS that fights usability
- `scrollIntoView` unless there is no safer option

Mobile hit targets should be at least 44px.

For print documents, text should be at least 12pt.

For 1920×1080 slide decks, text should generally be 24px or larger.

## React Guidance for Standalone HTML

Use plain HTML/CSS/JS by default.

Use React only when:

- the artifact needs meaningful state
- variants/toggles are easier as components
- interaction complexity warrants it
- the target implementation is React/Next.js and fidelity matters

If using React from CDN in standalone HTML:

- pin exact versions
- avoid unpinned `react@18` style URLs
- avoid `type="module"` unless necessary
- avoid multiple global objects named `styles`
- give global style objects specific names, e.g. `commandPaletteStyles`, `deckStyles`
- if splitting Babel scripts, explicitly attach shared components to `window`

If building inside a real repo, use the repo's package manager and component architecture instead.

## Typography

Use the existing type system if one exists.

If not, choose type deliberately based on the artifact:

- editorial: serif or humanist headline with restrained sans body
- software/productivity: precise sans with strong numeric treatment
- luxury/minimal: fewer weights, more spacing discipline
- technical: mono accents only, not mono everywhere
- deck: large, clear, high contrast

Avoid overused defaults when a stronger choice is appropriate.

If using web fonts, keep the number of families and weights low.

Use type as hierarchy before adding boxes, icons, or color.

## Color

Use brand/design-system colors first.

If no palette exists:

- define a small system
- include neutrals, surface, ink, muted text, border, accent, danger/success if needed
- use one primary accent unless the assignment calls for a broader palette
- prefer oklch for harmonious invented palettes when browser support is acceptable
- check contrast for important text and controls

Do not invent lots of colors from scratch.

## Layout and Composition

Design with rhythm:

- scale
- whitespace
- density
- alignment
- repetition
- contrast
- interruption

Avoid making every section the same card grid.

For product UIs, prioritize speed of comprehension over decoration.

For marketing surfaces, make one idea land per section.

For dashboards, avoid "data slop." Only show data that helps the user decide or act.

## Motion

Use motion as discipline, not theater.

Good motion:

- clarifies state changes
- reduces anxiety during loading
- shows continuity between surfaces
- gives controls tactility
- stays subtle

Bad motion:

- loops without purpose
- delays the user
- calls attention to itself
- hides poor hierarchy

Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for non-trivial animation.

## Images and Icons

Use real supplied imagery when available.

If an asset is missing:

- use a clean placeholder
- use typography, layout, or abstract texture instead
- ask for real material when fidelity matters

Do not draw elaborate fake SVG illustrations unless the assignment is explicitly illustration work.

Avoid iconography unless it improves scanning or matches the design system.
